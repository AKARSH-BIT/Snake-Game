# Snake-Game
My project name is snake game. The snake game firstly introduces in 1976 and developed by an American company name gremlin industry. It is a very popular and famous game. since a long time when we used the Nokia keypad-phone. It is a single-player game. There are two main elements which one is a snake and the other is food. The player controls a snake by pressing the arrow key. Snake move around the screen and eating food. With each food eaten the tail is grown by one unit. The goal of this game is to eat as many foods as possible. And achieve maximum points. Six important rules for this game are:-

1.Snake moves at a constant speed
2.Snake moves only in direction north, south, east, west.
3.Direction of snake control by arrow key
4.Food appears at a random location
5.When a snake eats food its tail gets longer.
6.When the snake crosses itself or touches a wall then the game will be over.
